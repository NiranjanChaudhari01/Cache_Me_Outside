John Smith visited New York City last week; he was excited to explore the city. He met Sarah Johnson at Central Park, where they spent the afternoon together. They walked down Broadway Street and had dinner at a restaurant in Manhattan: it was a wonderful evening. The next day, they traveled to Los Angeles to see the Hollywood Sign! While there, they met Michael Brown who works at UCLA. They also visited Santa Monica Beach and enjoyed the beautiful California weather.

Later that week, they went to San Francisco; the Golden Gate Bridge was amazing. They met Dr. Emily Davis at Stanford University, who showed them around the campus. After that, they visited Silicon Valley and met several tech entrepreneurs including Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk.
